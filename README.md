# EasyData360 - Landing Page

This project is a modern, professional, and fully responsive landing page for **EasyData360**, a software house specializing in custom digital solutions for businesses. The application is built as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern & Responsive UI**: Clean, professional design that adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Client-Side Routing**: A lightweight, custom routing solution provides a fast, SPA experience without full page reloads.
- **Dynamic Content Pages**: The application includes several pages:
  - **Home**: A comprehensive overview with sections for products, services, testimonials, and differentiators.
  - **Solutions**: A list of all software products, with dedicated detail pages for each one.
  - **Services**: A detailed breakdown of the consultancy and technical services offered.
  - **Blog**: A filterable and paginated list of articles, with individual pages for each post.
  - **Cases**: A showcase of success stories with clients.
  - **About, Support, Login, Demo**: Static pages with company information and forms.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features smooth animations, a sticky header, dropdown menus, and a testimonial carousel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Library**: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
- **Icons**: Custom SVG components.

The project is intentionally set up with a minimal toolchain, using a CDN for Tailwind CSS and an `importmap` for React to avoid a complex build process.

## 📁 Project Structure

The codebase is organized into features and shared components to promote separation of concerns and code reusability.

### Key Files & Concepts

- **`App.tsx`**: This component acts as the central router. It reads `window.location.pathname` and conditionally renders the appropriate page component.
- **`components/Link.tsx`**: A custom `Link` component that intercepts navigation. Instead of a full page refresh, it uses `window.history.pushState()` and dispatches a custom `pushstate` event, which `App.tsx` listens for to update the view. This creates the SPA behavior.
- **`features/**/data.ts`**: These files act as a simple, in-memory database for content like blog posts, solutions, and case studies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is a static web application and does not require a complex build step.

### Prerequisites

You need a simple local web server to serve the files. Most modern code editors have extensions for this (like "Live Server" for VS Code), or you can use a simple command-line tool.

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository (or have the files locally).**

2.  **Serve the project directory.**
    If you have Python installed, you can run a simple server from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

    If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx`:
    ```bash
    npx serve .
    ```

3.  **Open your browser.**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL provided by your server). The application should load and run.
